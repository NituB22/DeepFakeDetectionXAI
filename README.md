For training and validation of the deepfake detection model, we used Real and Fake Face dataset with 140K images available in https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/xhlulu/140k-real-and-fake-faces.
For the broader applicability of the model, we tested in a different dataset available in https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hamzaboulahia/hardfakevsrealfaces?resource=download.
